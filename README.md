# Shopify-Challenge

Welcome to my GitHub! I have uploaded the necessary document for this Shopify Data Science challenge here. 

For question 1 of the challenge, please download the "RawData.csv" file along with the "Data Science Challenge Question 1.ipynb". In addition, please check out my analysis on the Excel file, "(Excel) Data Science Challenge Question 1.xlsx", with an interactive dashboard. 

For question 2 of the challenge, please download the word file, "Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge.doc", for my queries and answers.

This challenge was fun and I truly enjoyed the process of learning new things in python such as pivot tables. I am open to any feedbacks!
